Ideas on how to flesh out the app:
-Personal nomad app vs itinerary travel guide?

    --Personal app: Someone who likes to travel can use the app for adding trips to their wishlist and organize the whole planning process,
    there would be a map that is able to be interacted with and holds pins for each location(hover effect, v-on:click effect). There
    will be a navigation bar, header, footer, and main body that incorporates the map. Users can view available lodging that is
    in the area desired, flights to get there in reference to where they want to depart from, etc

    --Itinerary guide: Shows a bunch of locations to travel to and still has the features of the personal app, includes
    all a list of things to do and places to go within a location once a trip is decided. Less like a personal journal and more of a
    helper for other people.

-What do checks will I need in order to make this happen?
    --Find a way to link external websites that have lodging of some sort(airbnb, vrbo, hotels) and have users enter the data
    for the lodging(cost, distance, etc.)
    --Add links to expedia, or other websites that retain potential cost information regarding flights and have the user type in the
    information needed regarding the flight.
    --Review service: Add a way for users to interact with a trip where they can leave ratings and a comment on how the trip went(CHECK HERE,
    ONLY ABLE TO DO IF VISITED THAT LOCATION)
    --Add a link to websites/blogs/photos representing that location

Instructions: 

Here are 2 different logins for testing purposes if you would like to use the app:
ADMIN(ROLE_ADMIN): username: ADMIN, password: PASSWORD1227
USER(ROLE_USER): username: DoughSec3, password: test3

These are pre-made users for you to see the difference between both the ADMIN view and USER views. Let me know asap if theres any issues logging in.
Of course, before running the npm run dev function, run the spring boot app located in the folder labeled as "m2-final-project-starter", path listed below - 
"C:\Users\Student\workspace\addison-doseck-student-code\module-3\week-9\final-project\server\m2-final-project-starter"

This is a continuation of my module 2 project and it is a booking app, dedicated to my girlfriend's cosmetology career.
After logging in, you should be navigated by default to the home page and there are navigation links that will let you check out different tabs where 
input could be possible but not for all users. 

Technically as a normal user you would need to register as a client first before making a booking but we talked about this already 
and the API phone validation use limit has ben reached sadly so it won't be used.

If you would like to register as a user, then you can do that to however I changed the register.vue file at line 98 from 
"user" to "ROLE_ADMIN". It would need to be "ROLE_USER" if default registration is for a user, feel free to change that if you want to see what the default
registration should look like(it works the same). All requirements are met, if any weird comments were left behind, I had worked with Andy Chong Sam on fixing some css
horizontal scrolling and he said that it should be fine based on what I have. Enjoy checking out my app!
